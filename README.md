## Introduction

Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exhibits high correlations in k-space and time. In order to accelerate the dynamic MR imaging and to exploit k-t correlations from highly undersampled data, here we develop novel deep learning based approaches for dynamic MR image reconstruction in both single-coil and multi-coil acquisition settings. The developed approaches are termed k-t NEXT (k-t NEtwork with X-f Transform) for sinlge-coil setting and CTFNet (Complementary Time-Frequency domain Network) for multi-coil setting. The networks are able to effectively capture useful information and jointly exploit spatio-temporal correlations from both complementary domains (x-f and image domains). 

This repository contains the implementation of k-t NEXT and CTFNet including the CRNN-MRI module using PyTorch, along with a simple demo. PyTorch version needs to be higher than Torch 0.4.

## Usage

To train k-t NEXT on single-coil data:

    python main_kt_NEXT.py --acceleration_factor 4
  
To train CTFNet on multi-coil data:

    python main_CTFNet.py --acceleration_factor 8
